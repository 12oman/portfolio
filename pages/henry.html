      My chosen topic was the reptile endemic to New Zealand, the tuatara. The brand was named after the oldest tuatara in the world, currently residing at the Southland Museum in Invercargill.
      My research showed that most people found tuataras scary and intimidating. To help change this misconception, I opted for bright colours and simplified forms to create a friendly and playful aesthetic.
      The style guide featured instructions for the use of logos, colour schemes, typography and iconography.
